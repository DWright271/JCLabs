# Class Notes for Introduction to Full Stack Java

These notes provide:
1. A guide to the structure of the class
2. Links to any online resources mentioned in class
3. Notes on any other topics raised in class

These notes will be updated nightly after each day's class.

### Introductions

1. What your technical background is
2. Your programming experience (Java)
3. Your expectations for class - what you want to learn

## Setup

### IDEs

While we will be using Eclipse as our lab environment IDE, there are several others that are popular with Java Developers

##### IntelliJ
- This is considered by many to be the most up to date IDE. It is part of the JetBrains Toolbox which consists of a number of language specific IDEs
- IntelliJ has a free community version and a paid developer version.
- The community version can be downloaded from
-   https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows

##### Visual Studio Code
- One of the most popular IDEs, it supports community plugins for development in most programming languages and development frameworks.
- It can be downloaded from here:
-   https://code.visualstudio.com/
- There is a guide for setting up VSC for Java development here:
-  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial

## Module One: Java

- History of Java  https://www.wikizero.com/en/Java_(programming_language)
- Java language and virtual machine specifications
- References to the JVM architecture https://medium.com/javarevisited/java-virtual-machine-and-its-architecture-2d8de5599500

## OO Programming
#### Reference counting
- JVM keeps of track of how many references are made to a piece of memory.

## Design Notes

(x,y) -> { code }
f(X,y) = { EQUATION}

int  [] a = new int[90];


1. Failure - anyplace the code does not do what it's supposed to do
   1. Where a test fails
2. Faults - errors in the code that produce failure 
3. Errors - human mistakes that cause faults.

4. Fault in the evironment 
   1. Exception is a fault in the environment
   2. Handle the exception

## Functional versus nonfunctional

### Function

- OB1 -> f() Asp()  f() -> OB2
